There is little economic anal-\nysis of these issues, however, and it is unclear whether slowing the development and adoption\nof a promising, transformative technology would ever make sense.\nIn this paper, we develop a framework to provide a first set of insights on these questions.\nWe consider a multi-sector economy that initially uses an old technology and can switch to a\nnew, transformative technology. This technology is transformative both because it enables a\nhigher growth rate of output and because it is general-purpose and can be adopted across all\nsectors of the economy. Partly because of its transformative nature, it also poses new risks.\nWe model these by assuming that there is a positive probability of a disaster, meaning that the\ntechnology will turn out to have many harmful uses across a number of sectors. If a disaster\nis realized, some of the sectors that had previously started using the new technology may not\nbe able to switch away from it, despite the social damages. Whether there will be a disaster or\nnot is initially unknown, and society can learn about it over time. Critically, we also assume\nthat the greater are the capabilities enabled by the new technology, the more damaging it will\nbe when it is used for harmful purposes.3\nIn this environment, we study (socially) optimal and equilibrium adoption decisions. We\nfirst show that it is optimal to have a gradual adoption path, because this enables greater\nlearning. If all sectors immediately adopted the new technology and the disaster transpired,\nmany of them would not be able to switch back and avoid the negative social consequences.\nGradual adoption instead allows society to update its knowledge and beliefs about whether\nthis transformative technology will have socially damaging uses. Specifically, we assume that\nas more time passes without the disaster, the belief that there will be a disaster declines (\u201cno\nnews is good news\u201d). As society thus becomes more optimistic, it is optimal to adopt the new\n1https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/ai-threat-warning.html\n2https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\n3Both of these assumptions can be motivated with generative AI applications. For irreversibility, once large\nlanguage models like ChatGPT are deployed in secondary education, it may be impossible to roll back their use,\neven after it becomes clear that they harm student learning. For the damages rising with productivity, many\nexperts\u2019 fears are centered on these technologies either posing existential risks because of their capabilities or\nbeing misused, which would be more damaging when they have greater productivity (e.g., Shevlane, Farquhar,\nGarfinkel, Phuong, et al., 2023).\n1",
        "a7e455bc-5ba4-40dd-9954-28e5d34c280a": "technology across a larger number of sectors. We show that under reasonable conditions this\nadoption path is slow and convex, accelerating only after society is fairly certain that a disaster\nwill not occur. A simple quantitative example indicates that, for reasonable parameters on the\nnew technology\u2019s growth advantage and disaster risk, optimal adoption can be very slow.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we also show that adoption should be slower when the new technol-\nogy has a higher growth rate (and damages from a disaster are large). This is for two reasons.\nFirst, since damages after a potential disaster increase with the capabilities of the new tech-\nnology, a higher growth rate means that these damages also grow more quickly. Second, with\na higher growth rate the effective discount rate for future output declines, so that short delays\nin adoption are not very consequential for discounted utility.\nWhen compared to optimal adoption, equilibrium adoption can be inefficiently fast because\nprivate firms internalize only part of the social damages from a disaster. Even the order in\nwhich sectors adopt the new technology can differ systematically between the equilibrium and\nthe optimum\u2014sectors that have high social damages are not necessarily those that have high\nprivate damages for adopters.4\nFinally, we discuss how regulatory schemes can help to close the gap between optimal and\nequilibrium adoption decisions. Pigovian taxes, use taxes, or adoption taxes that are sector-\nspecific can fully implement the optimal adoption decisions. When sector-specific policies are\nnot feasible, it is generally not possible to implement optimal technology choices, but regula-\ntory actions may still be useful. In particular, it may improve welfare to prohibit use of the new\ntechnology in the sectors with the largest potential for harm until the risk of a disaster is low\nenough to justify broader use.\nWe view this paper as a first attempt to think about the consquences and regulation of\ntransformative technologies that can be used for good or bad objectives. There are three im-\nportant literatures on which we build. The first is a growing literature on economic disasters\nand their consequences (e.g., Rietz, 1988; Barro, 2006, 2009; Weitzman, 2009, 2011; Martin\nand Pindyck, 2015, 2021). This literature explores how the risk of rare economic disasters\naffects asset prices and cost-benefit analysis, but it typically does not focus on questions of\ntechnology adoption.\nThe second is a literature on technology adoption under a variety of market structures\nand institutional settings (e.g., Katz and Shapiro, 1986; Parente and Prescott, 1994; Foster\nand Rosenzweig, 1995, 2010; Acemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti, 2006; Acemoglu, Antr\u00e0s, and\nHelpman, 2007; Comin and Hobijn, 2010; Comin and Mestieri, 2014). Early work touching on\nAI and regulation includes papers by Galasso and Luo (2018) and Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb\n4For example, if AI is used to create pervasive disinformation on social media, this may be disastrous for\ndemocracy but profitable for social media platforms.\n2",
        "b3ba17a4-2744-42e2-8812-1ea216f89355": "(2019), which discuss implications of privacy, trade, and liability policies for the adoption of\nAI. These models are similar to our framework, but they do not focus on issues of learning\nabout social damages from new technologies.\nThird, there is a nascent literature focusing on negative consequences from certain types\nof technologies, including environmental damages (e.g., Bovenberg and Smulders, 1995; Ace-\nmoglu, Aghion, Bursztyn, and Hemous, 2012). Most closely related to our paper are a few\nworks that discuss the dilemma between growth and existential risk from new technologies,\nincluding AI. Jones (2023) develops a one-sector growth model in which AI can be used to\nraise the aggregate growth rate, but with small probability causes human extinction. Whether\nit is optimal to use AI depends crucially on the coefficient of relative risk aversion and whether\nconsumption utility is bounded. Similarly, Aschenbrenner (2020) incorporates existential risk\ninto Jones\u2019s (2016) model of growth and mortality, and argues that existential risk rises with\nconsumption unless new mitigation technologies are developed. His model thus exhibits an\n\u201cexistential risk Kuznets curve\u201d in which existential risk optimally increases until sufficient R&D\nresources are shifted toward mitigation. These two papers share our focus on the costs and\nbenefits of transformative technologies, but do not address the speed of adoption across sectors\nand do not feature learning about risks over time. We are not aware of any other papers that\nincorporate these critical aspects of our work.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our benchmark model.\nSections 3 and 4 characterize optimal and equilibrium technology choices. Section 5 discusses\nthe conditions under which optimal technology choices can be restored through regulatory\ntaxes, and Section 6 concludes. Omitted proofs and extensions are in the Appendix.\n2 Setup\nWe consider a continuous-time economy that linearly produces a unique final good from a\ncontinuum of sectors i\u2208[0, 1]:\nY=Z1\n0Yidi.\nA representative household has risk-neutral preferences defined over this final good and dis-\ncounts the future at the rate \u03c1>0.\nEach sector can use an old technology Oor a new, transformative technology N. We let\nQj(t)>0 denote the time tquality of technology j\u2208{O ,N}, and we let xi(t) =1 if sector\niswitches its production process to technology N, while otherwise we let xi(t) =0. Sectoral\noutput can then be written Yi= (1\u2212xi)QO+xi\u03b1iQN, where\u03b1idesignates the comparative\n3",

First, it is general-purpose and can\nbe applied across all of the sectors of the economy. Second, it enables not just the production\nof more output, but a higher growth rate:\ngN>gO\u22650.\nThird, because of its restructuring impact on the economy, it poses new risks. We model these\nby assuming that there may be a disaster whereby the new technology\u2019s greater productive\ncapacity also generates negative effects. If a disaster happens, then there will be damages of\n\u03b4iQN>0 (in units of the final good) in the sectors that are using the technology. Because of\npossible irreversibilities, with probability \u03b7i\u2208(0, 1) sector icannot switch to technology Oif\nit is using technology Nwhen the disaster strikes. The realization of this reversibility event\nis independent across sectors. We assume that damages are proportional to QNbecause the\nnegative effects correspond to misusing the better capabilities of the new technology.\nIn what follows, we reorder sectors so that \u03b4iis increasing and assume that idenotes the\nquantiles of the \u03b4distribution, so that we can take this distribution to be uniform over some\ninterval [\u03b4,\u03b4].

First, we model damages in each sector iby the reduced-\nform function \u03b4iQNto capture a broad range of potential harms from the new technology. In\nthe context of AI, these include the spread of disinformation that harms democracy; mass un-\nemployment; and the disruption of production in many sectors from AI-aided cyberattacks.5\n5Our functional form assumptions also impose that the rate of substitution between gross consumption and\n4",

For example, if AI capabilities are used\nto produce disinformation, the costs will be proportional to how good these capabilities are.\nThird, we assume that the arrival rate of the disaster\u2014and hence learning about the negative\neffects of the new technology\u2014is independent of how many sectors switch to the new technol-\nogy. This is mostly for simplicity, but is not unreasonable since many of the potential misuses\nof a new technology can be gradually recognized, even when this technology is not fully rolled\nout.6\n3 Socially Optimal Technology Choice\nIn this section, we set up, solve, and provide comparative statics for the social planner\u2019s prob-\nlem.\n3.1 Social Planner\u2019s Problem\nGiven risk neutrality, the (social) planner\u2019s objective is\nV(0) =E\u00b5(0)\u0014Z\u221e\n0exp(\u2212\u03c1t) [Y((t)\u2212D(t)]dt\u0015\n, (1)\nwhere Y(t)andD(t)denote output and damages at time tand the expectation E\u00b5(0)is with\nrespect to the prior belief \u00b5(0)over the disaster\u2019s arrival time T. To ensure that the objective\nis well-defined, we assume\n\u03c1>gN, (2)\nwhich rules out the case in which the new technology grows so quickly that discounted utility\nbecomes infinite.\nIt is more convenient to work with the recursive formulation of (1), which has three state\nvariables: the posterior belief of disaster, \u00b5; the time-varying qualities of the old and new\ntechnologies, Q; and, after the disaster (if any), the set of sectors that were already using the\nnew technology and for which this use is irreversible. We track these sectors using the vector\n\u00afx= (\u00afxi)i\u2208[0,1], where \u00afxi=1 if sector iuses technology Nirreversibly and \u00afxi=0 otherwise. Let\nV(\u00b5,Q)denote pre-disaster household welfare, and let W(\u00afx,Q)denote post-disaster welfare.\ndamages in utility is constant and equal to one. Jones (2023) points out that this may not hold in the case of\nexistential risk and explores the implications for optimal use of a life-threatening new technology.\n6Alternative assumptions are discussed in Section 6.\n5",

(4)\nEquation (4) imposes that xicannot be less than \u00afxi, since if \u00afxi=1 sector i\u2019s use of the new tech-\nnology has turned out to be irreversible. Given this, Vdepends on the conditional expectation\nof welfare after a disaster given the current technology choices x, denoted by E[W(\u00afx,Q)|x].7\nIn (3) we also use the fact that the arrival rate of the disaster, given the posterior \u00b5, is\u00b5\u03bb.\nTo characterize the planner\u2019s technology choices, suppose first that the disaster has oc-\ncurred. The planner\u2019s problem in (4) is linear, so the solution is\nxi=\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f31 if \u00afxi=1 or (\u03b1i\u2212\u03b4i)QN>QO,\n0 else.\nThis expression imposes, without loss of generality, that the planner sticks with the old technol-\nogy if indifferent. It also incorporates the fact that the planner is constrained to choose xi=1\nif\u00afxi=1. Even when unconstrained, it may be optimal to set xi=1 if the output produced\nby technology Nexceeds its damages plus the output that can be produced by technology O.\nIn the remainder of the text we assume that damages are sufficiently large that, whenever\npossible, the planner chooses technology Oafter a disaster:\n\u03b1i\u2264\u03b4i. (5)\nThis enables us to focus on the most interesting case where damages exceed the benefits of the\nnew technology.

Since\u00b5is decreasing and\nQN/QOis nondecreasing, for any initial state (\u00b5(0),Q(0))there exists a time ti<\u221esuch\nthat technology Ois used in sector before tiand technology Nis used thereafter.\n3.2 Socially Optimal Technology Adoption\nTo determine how (socially) optimal use of technology Nchanges over time, denote the fraction\nof sectors that use technology N, or total adoption, by\nX(\u00b5,q) =Z1\n0xi(\u00b5,q)di,\nwhere q=log(QN/QO)is the quality gap between the technologies, and xi(\u00b5,q) =1 iff it is\noptimal to use technology Nin sector iin state (\u00b5,q).

These assumptions imply that there exists a damage threshold\nL(\u00b5,q)such that it is optimal to adopt the new technology in sector iiff\u03b4i<L(\u00b5,q). Total\nadoption of the new technology is then just the fraction of sectors below the damage threshold:\nX(\u00b5,q) =F(L(\u00b5,q)).\nThe following proposition is immediate from (6), and we omit its proof:\nProposition 1. It is socially optimal to use technology N in sector i iff \u03b4i<L(\u00b5,q), where\nL(\u00b5,q)\u2212\u03b1\n\u03c1\u2212gN=\u03b1\u2212exp(\u2212q)\n\u00b5\u03bb\u03b7\u2212exp(\u2212q)\n\u03c1\u2212gO.

Proposition 1 then implies that when the new technology\nenables faster growth, its adoption should be slower. This is because of a precautionary chan-\nnel\u2014even though the planner is risk neutral, she would like to avoid the risk of irreversible\ndamages from the new technology, and this introduces a precautionary motive. The faster the\nnew technology grows, the greater are its potential damages as well, and this strengthens the\n7",

The belief\u00b5(t)does not depend on the growth rates gOandgN, but the\nquality gap q(t)does, since q(t) =q(0) + ( gN\u2212gO)t. Because the damage threshold L(\u00b5,q)\nis increasing in the quality gap, any change in the growth rates affects adoption at each time\nt>0 through both the direct effects described in Proposition 1 and the indirect effects through\nchanges in the quality gap q(t).

Adoption falls to zero as gNapproaches\u03c1, i.e., limgN\u2191\u03c1X(\u00b5(t),q(t)) =0.\nThe proof of this proposition and other results in the text are presented in Appendix A,\nunless otherwise stated.\nThe first part of Proposition 2 establishes that the comparative static for gOfrom Proposi-\ntion 1 generalizes in the presence of the indirect effects through q(t)\u2014the quality gap q(t)is\ndeclining in gO, reinforcing the direct effect. The second part shows that the new technology\u2019s\ngrowth rate has more nuanced implications: Adoption is not always decreasing in gN, but is\nafter some critical time \u00aft, and this time itself is a decreasing function of gN. In this case, the\nprecautionary channel highlighted above must compete with the fact that the quality gap q(t)\nis increasing in gN, but this indirect effect can dominate only at short time horizons.\nThe third part of proposition establishes that as gNincreases towards the discount rate,\nadoption almost stops. This might appear paradoxical initially, but it is also intuitive. When\ngNis approximately equal to \u03c1, the benefits from the new technology are very high, leading to\nnearly infinite discounted utility provided no disaster arrives. Delay in initiating the adoption\nof the technology has little effect on these benefits. However, a disaster will have huge negative\nconsequences, and avoiding this disaster now takes precedence.\n8This holds because, under (5), post-disaster net output is decreasing in QNin each sector using the new\ntechnology. In Appendix B, we show that when this assumption is relaxed, so that post-disaster net output can\nbe increasing in QNfor some sectors iwith\u03b4i<\u03b1, the damage threshold L(\u00b5,Q)and adoption X(\u00b5,Q)may be\nincreasing in gN.\n8",

When\ntechnology Ogrows more quickly, it slows the rate of increase in the quality gap and raises the\nopportunity cost of using technology Nafter the disaster for a fixed quality gap. As a result, the\ndamage threshold grows less quickly in each state. When technology Ngrows more quickly, it\nraises both the rate of increase in the quality gap and the net output losses from technology N\nafter the disaster. The latter effect dominates when the quality gap is sufficiently large because\nadditional improvements in technology Nrelative to Ohave only a negligible impact on the\nplanner\u2019s technology choice.9\nThe second part of the proposition proves that when the new technology\u2019s growth advan-\ntage is sufficiently large, its adoption will eventually have a major convex segment in which its\nadoption accelerates.

This is\nbecause expected damages from technology Nin sector iare proportional to the posterior \u00b5,\nand as\u00b5declines, larger increases in the damage threshold L(\u00b5,q)are needed to balance the\nexpected damages and benefits in the \u201cmarginal\u201d sector.10\n9The latter effect also dominates regardless of the quality gap whenever L(\u00b5,z)>0 and gN\u2212gO\u2265\u03c1\u2212gN.\n10In Appendix C, we verify this intuition by showing that learning dynamics favor concave adoption when sectors\nare heterogeneous according to \u03b1iinstead of\u03b4i.\n9",

We set gO=2% in line with trend GDP growth in developed economies and\n\u03c1=0.04 to produce a risk-free interest rate of 4%. We choose two values for gNbased on Chui,\nRoberts, Yee, Hazan, et al. (2023), who forecast an increase in the growth rate of 0.6-3.6%\nin the United States between 2023 and 2040 from AI and other automation technologies. We\ntake the lower end of this range, gN\u2212gO=0.6%, and a higher but still conservative estimate\nfrom the middle of the range: gN\u2212gO=1.8% (while still satisfying (2)). We take the two\ntechnologies to have the same quality in year t=0, thus q(0) = 0. We suppose that the\nrange of damages is from one to five times gross sectoral output ( \u03b4=1,\u00af\u03b4=5), and we\nset\u03b7=0.5 so that half of all sectors using the new technology cannot switch back after a\ndisaster. We set the expected arrival time of a disaster (if one exists) to be 20 years, which\ngives\u03bb=0.05. Finally, a recent survey of AI experts reports a median estimate of existential\nrisk of about 10%,11and since we are interested in non-existential misuses of AI as well, we\nchoose the initial disaster probability to be twice as large, \u00b5(0) = 20%. Figure 1 shows that\noptimal adoption is slow, taking about 40 years until full adoption when gN=2.6% and almost\n60 years when gN=3.8%.\nIn summary, this section has established that the optimal adoption of a new, transformative\n11https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai\n10",

Notably, a higher growth rate for a transformative technology can lead to slower optimal\nadoption.\n4 Equilibrium Technology Choice\nWe now turn to a characterization of equilibrium technology adoption, assuming that private\nfirms do not internalize all social damages after a disaster.\n4.1 The Firm\u2019s Problem\nSuppose now that in each sector, the choice of technology is made by a private (representative)\nfirm that seeks to maximize expected discounted profits. To simplify, we assume that the firm\nin sector iappropriates all output of its intermediate as profits, but only internalizes private\ndamages\u03b3i\u2264\u03b4i.\nThe firm\u2019s profit maximization problem can be formulated recursively in the same way as\nthe planner\u2019s problem in the previous section. The state variables before the disaster are again\n\u00b5andQ, and the state variables relevant for firm iafter the disaster are \u00afxiandQ. Let\u03a0i(\u00b5,Q)\ndenote the firm\u2019s pre-disaster value, \u03a6i(\u00afxi,Q)the firm\u2019s post-disaster value, and Yi(xi,Q)its\n(gross) output. The HJB equations for the firm are\n\u03c1\u03a0i(\u00b5,Q) =max\nxi\u2208{0,1}{Yi(xi,Q) +\u00b5\u03bb(E[\u03a6i(\u00afxi,Q)|xi]\u2212\u03a0i(\u00b5,Q))}+\u02d9\u03a0i(\u00b5,Q), (8)\n\u03c1\u03a6i(\u00afxi,Q) = max\nxi\u2208{\u00afxi,1}\b\nY(xi,Q)\u2212xi\u03b3iQN\t\n+\u02d9\u03a6i(\u00afxi,Q). (9)\nThese value functions differ from the planner\u2019s, (3) and (4), because the firm internalizes only\na fraction\u03b3i/\u03b4iof the flow damages from technology N.\nWe assume that private damages are also sufficiently large that firm iwill always choose\ntechnology Oafter the disaster if possible:12\n\u03b1i\u2264\u03b3i. (10)\n12Without this assumption, the equilibrium would be even more inefficient, as firms will continue to use the\nnew technology in some (reversible) sectors even after a disaster.\n11",

Equilibrium adoption is\nthen\n\u02dcX(\u00b5,q) =F\u03b3(L(\u00b5,q)),\nwhere F\u03b3is the cumulative density function of \u03b3i.\nThis characterization implies that all comparative statics results from Section 3.2 also ap-\nply to equilibrium adoption. In particular, the results in Propositions 1 and 3 concern only\nthe damage threshold L(\u00b5,q)and apply exactly as stated, while Proposition 2 applies after\nreplacing X(\u00b5,q)with \u02dcX(\u00b5,q)(and so we omit their proofs):\nProposition 4. For all t>0:\n1.\u02dcX(\u00b5(t),q(t))is decreasing in gO.\n2.

Adoption falls to zero as gNincreases to\u03c1:limgN\u2191\u03c1\u02dcX(\u00b5(t),q(t)) =0.\nIn the remainder of this section, we seek to understand how the optimal and equilibrium\nadoption curves differ when private damages \u03b3idiverge from social damages \u03b4i. First observe\nthat even similar adoption curves do not imply that the equilibrium is optimal, because the\n12",

In this case, the order in which the new technology spreads in equilibrium is exactly\nthe opposite of the optimal order.\nEven when equilibrium and optimal orders of adoption coincide, the equilibrium can be\ninefficient. To see this, suppose that social and private damages are positively affiliated, so that\nthere exists a non-negative and strictly increasing function \u03bawith\u03b3i=\u03ba(\u03b4i)\u2264\u03b4i.

The equilibrium damage threshold is always greater than the social damage threshold:\n\u02dcL(\u00b5,q)\u2265L(\u00b5,q).\n2.

We\nillustrate them in Figure 2 by depicting socially optimal and equilibrium adoption curves for the\nbenchmark parameterizations in Figure 1 and a concave affiliation function \u03ba.

Consequently, equilibrium\nadoption is inefficiently rapid and accelerates when there are high social damages.\nIn summary, equilibrium adoption of transformative technologies is determined by the same\nforces that shape optimal adoption. However, because firms are motivated by higher produc-\ntivity and discouraged only by private damages, equilibrium adoption is generally suboptimal:\nFirms do not fully internalize social damages from potential disasters, so equilibrium adop-\ntion is typically too high and rises too quickly, and the order in which sectors adopt the new\ntechnology may differ from the optimal one.\n5 Regulating Technology Choice\nSince equilibrium adoption is potentially inefficient, a natural question is whether government\nregulation can close the gap between equilibrium and optimal adoption decisions. Throughout\nthis section, we simplify the analysis by focusing on ex ante regulations.13\nSocially optimal and equilibrium technology choices differ because the planner and private\nfirms internalize different damages after the disaster and hence different expected damages\n13We ignore ex post (\u201cPigovian\u201d) taxes both because their analysis is essentially identical to our characterization\nof use taxes, and also because they may not be credible as they do not affect technology choice after the disaster\u2014\nthe private sector already stops using the new technology whenever possible.\n14",

Despite a\nmultifaceted public discussion about their regulation, there are currently no economic models\nof the regulation of transformative technologies. This paper has taken a first step in building\nsuch a model to provide insights for this debate.\nWe consider the adoption decision of a new, transformative technology that can increase\nproductivity growth across all sectors of the economy but also raises risks of misuse, which\nwe model as the stochastic arrival of a \u201cdisaster\u201d. If a disaster occurs, some of the sectors\nthat started using the new technology may be unable to switch back to the old, safe technol-\nogy and generate social damages. We assume that the likelihood of a disaster is unknown\nand society gradually learns about whether such a disaster will occur. We show that adoption\nshould be slow and follow a convex path, initially growing slowly before accelerating later.\nThis slow adoption is motivated by social learning about the likelihood of a disaster\u2014as the\nposterior probability of a disaster declines over time, adoption increases. Most surprisingly, a\n16",
        "3650b6bd-73c6-4abd-820b-e0a0eacf3a9e": "faster growth rate of the new technology should lead to slower adoption. This is because of a\nprecautionary channel: Despite the fact that the planner is risk neutral, irreversible damages\nimply that it is optimal to wait and learn about the likelihood of a disaster. These irreversible\ndamages are greater when the new technology has a higher growth rate, strengthening the\nprecautionary motive. Finally, if private firms internalize only part of the social damages from\ntransformative technologies, equilibrium adoption tends to be too fast and necessitates regu-\nlatory policies, some of which we characterized.\nThere are many interesting areas left for future work. First, we assumed, both as a natu-\nral benchmark and for tractability, that the rate at which society learns about the likelihood\nof a disaster is independent of which sectors have adopted the technology. In practice, early\nadoption may increase risks or may facilitate learning. In addition, there may be sector-specific\nlearning about \u201csafe use\u201d of the new technology. These considerations may motivate \u201cexperi-\nmentation\u201d by adopting the technology in a few sectors or trying different uses in some areas.\nAn analysis of these types of experimentation is an interesting area for future work. Second,\nmany of the misuses of new AI technologies depend on market structure and other aspects of\nregulation (e.g., concerning disinformation, discrimination, or privacy), and it would be inter-\nesting to explore how these affect optimal and equilibrium adoption. Third, we simplified the\nanalysis by assuming risk neutrality. As explored in Jones (2023), the extent of risk aversion\nin the social welfare function has a first-order effect on the trade-off between higher growth\nand the likelihood of a disaster, and these can be incorporated in future analyses of learning\nabout misuses of new transformative technologies. Fourth, we also abstracted from any choices\nabout how new technologies may be used. If regulations or other factors can prevent misuse\nof technology, then faster adoption can become optimal. Finally, we showed that the optimal\npath of adoption depends on a few parameters, but there is currently a huge amount of un-\ncertainty about the values of these parameters, and careful empirical assessments of the costs\nand benefits of the adoption of new transformative technologies, such as generative AI, is an\nobvious area for fruitful research.\n17",

However, the comparative static with respect to gNis sensitive to this\nassumption. When damages in the marginal sector exceed output ( L(\u00b5,q)>\u03b1), the damage\nthreshold is decreasing in gNas in Proposition 1. When damages in the marginal sector are\nbelow output ( L(\u00b5,q)<\u03b1), the damage threshold is instead increasing in gN.\nThe following proposition generalizes Proposition 2 to provide full comparative statics for\nadoption with respect to the growth rates gOandgN, including both the direct effects described\nin Proposition B.1 and the indirect effects through the state (\u00b5(t),q(t)).\nProposition B.2.

The final result of the proposition follows by taking the limit gN\u2191\u03c1\nin (B3). Notably, in this limit adoption does not tend to either of the extreme values 0 or\nF(\u03b1), in contrast to the corresponding result in Proposition 2. This holds because, for any\nsector iwith\u03b4i<\u03b1, the discounted net output after the disaster tends to infinity as gN\u2191\u03c1\nregardless of whether the sector is constrained to use technology Nafter the disaster. However,\nthedifference between the discounted net output when unconstrained and the discounted net\noutput when constrained tends to a finite limit. Socially optimal technology choices before the\ndisaster depend on this difference (see B2), so provided that \u03b4iis sufficiently close to \u03b1and\nthe initial quality gap q(0)sufficiently low, it can remain optimal to delay using technology N\nin sector ibefore the disaster even when gN\u2191\u03c1.\nWe illustrate these results in Figure 3 by depicting adoption curves for a stylized param-\neterization of the model. We modify the calibration of Figure 1 only by assuming that the\ndistribution of damages \u03b4iis uniform over [0, 5] instead of [1, 5]. Technology choices for sec-\ntors with\u03b4i\u2208[1, 5]are exactly as in Section 3, and since these sectors comprise 5/6 of all\nsectors in this calibration, the adoption curves in Figure 3 when X(t)\u22655/6 are identical to\nthe adoption curves in Figure 1.\nB-4",
